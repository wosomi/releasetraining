The Nimzo-Indian is a chess opening for Black that begins with the moves \(1.d4Nf6,2.c4e6,\) and \(3.Nc3Bb4\). Black's key idea is to pin White's knight on \(c3\) with the bishop, preventing an immediate central expansion with \(4.e4\). The opening is known for being flexible and strategically complex, often leading to exchanges that give Black an improved pawn structure at the cost of the bishop pair. A common follow-up is for Black to eventually trade the bishop for the knight, doubling White's c-pawns, which can become a long-term weakness
